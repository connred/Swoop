IoT Challenge
Our project is a tool designed to minimize time spent searching for your next form of transportation. Using GPS tracking in cars, buses, and cabs. We can gather data and send this data to our servers. Using your current location we will be able to determine the cheapest and fastest ride to your desired location.
